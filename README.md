# Vue.js 3 CRUD Application

This is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built using **Vue.js 3**, **Vue Router**, and **Bulma CSS**. It manages a list of products, allowing users to add, edit, view, delete, and search through items. Data is stored temporarily in memory (no backend/database).

## Features

* ✅ Add new products with `name` and `guid`
* 🔍 Search products by name or guid
* ✏️ Edit existing products
* 🗑️ Delete products with confirmation
* 👁️ View product details with comments (predefined or customizable)
* 💅 Styled using Bulma CSS and Font Awesome
* ⚙️ Frontend-only — no backend required

## Technologies Used

* [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Vue Router 4](https://router.vuejs.org/)
* [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Code**
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start using the app — no build tools or server required

---

## Folder Structure

```
.
├── index.html     # Main app file (all HTML + JS inline)
```

---

## How it Works

* Vue.js handles the reactive frontend
* Vue Router is used for page navigation
* Products are stored in a JavaScript array (`products`)
* Components are defined using HTML `<template>` tags
* Operations (`add`, `edit`, `delete`) update the `products` array directly

---

## Limitations

* ❌ No persistent storage (data will reset on refresh)
* ❌ No form validation beyond required fields
* 🧪 For demonstration and learning purposes only
